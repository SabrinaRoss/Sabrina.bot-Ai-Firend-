# Sabrina.bot-Ai-Firend-
thought it would be fun to make a little Ai companion.

Dependencies: 

  - Azure Speech API Key (TTS and STT)
  - ClaudeAi API Key 
  
  - Note: ChatGPT version of this does not currently work since I would need to get a OpenAi API key to test and I have accidentily, locked myself out of my card and how not found the motivation to reset it

  Optional (if you want a avatar to mouth what the Ai says):
    
  - VB-Audio Cable,
    
  - VTuber Studio
  
- To run this application please run the VTuber_Studio_Support_App.py (this does not only apply to the avatar code, I just did not feel like making another starter file), 
- Optional! If using VTuber Studio connect one audio channel to VB-Audio-Cable and another to your prefered listening channel
- Click the poorly made blue button to start speaking into the program
- Wait awhile
- Than click play
